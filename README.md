# Machine Learning Analysis

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze three datasets:
1. **Airline Passenger Satisfaction** - Predicting customer satisfaction based on service-related factors.
2. **Energy Consumption Analysis** - Understanding appliance energy usage and predicting consumption.
3. **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** - Classifying tweets into sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).

Various machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting are applied to extract insights and make predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Regression and classification models applied to different datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance measured using R-squared, MAE, RMSE, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Identifying important predictors to improve accuracy.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zuu-Zuu/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Projects
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the respective notebooks for each dataset analysis.
